<h1>STM32</h1><p>I have spend quite a lot of time on the <a href="/esp32">ESP32</a> and for a lot of IOT related projects it is a hell of a micro processor having both Bluetooth and WiFi included. However, the documentation is quite a mess and what is worse, so is the software provided by Espressif. Sure, the processor included 2 cores (actually 3) running at up to 240 MHz, but in reality, due to the way it relies on FreeRTOS, a lot of the functionality runs much slower than it should, because a lot of concurrency checks have to be performed.</p>
