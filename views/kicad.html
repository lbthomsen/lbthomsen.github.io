<set-title title="KiCAD"></set-title><set-meta name="description" content="Writing about KiCAD"></set-meta><set-meta name="keywords" content="engineering,electronics,pcb"></set-meta><h1>KiCAD</h1><p>Back eons ago when I was studying, having PCBs professionally manufactured, was so costly that there was no way a poor student could get anywhere near it. I vaguely remember using (probably pirated) copies of Protel and OrCAD, but in reality the complexity of the PCBs we did create were hardly more than we could have used a permanent marker on a piece of PCB and then etch that.</p><p>Getting back into electronics some 20 years later, the first tool that caught my eye was Eagle, and I spend enough time on the free version to get the hang of it and even got a few boards manufactured from Oshpark (which would accept the eagle pcb file directly - so none of that Gerber nonsense necessary).</p><p>I am a sucker for Open Source software to a point where I am willing to suffer a bit to use it, so naturally at some point I took a hard look at KiCAD.</p>
